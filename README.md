# TinyBeast FPGA: A Compact Powerhouse for Embedded Systems

**TinyBeast FPGA** is a high-performance, low-power FPGA solution designed to accelerate industrial and embedded computing tasks. Leveraging the capabilities of the PolarFire FPGA, TinyBeast offloads demanding workloads from the main processor, resulting in significant performance improvements and reduced latency.

## Key Features
**Compact Form Factor** Available in two versions:

 1. TinyBeast FPGA P: Mini PCIe form factor for easy integration into existing embedded systems.

 1. TinyBeast FPGA S: Small System-on-Module (SoM) format for maximum flexibility and prototyping.

**High-Performance FPGA:** Powered by the Microchip MPF300T PolarFire FPGA, offering a balance of performance and power efficiency.

**Abundant Memory:** Equipped with 4GB of DDR4 memory for data-intensive applications.

**Versatile I/O:** Provides a rich set of I/O options, including GPIOs, high-speed transceivers, and various connectivity interfaces.

**AI Acceleration:** Supports Microchip's VectorBlox technology for efficient AI inference at the edge.

**Open Development Environment:** Offers open schematics, sample firmware, and PC software to facilitate custom development and community engagement.

## Target Applications
TinyBeast FPGA is ideally suited for a wide range of industrial and embedded applications, including:

**Automation:** Real-time data acquisition, control, and actuation.

**Measurement:** High-precision sensor data processing and analysis.

**Robotics:** Motion control, sensor fusion, and autonomous navigation.

**AI at the Edge:** Predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and image recognition.
